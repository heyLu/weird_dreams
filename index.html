	<h1>weird dreams</h1>
	<h2>A few little things I made for you (and myself, too).</h2>

	<p>These are a few little demos I've worked on over the last year
	or so. All of these are small, self-contained and run in the
	browser (using HTML5, CSS and Coffee-/JavaScript).</p>

	<p>If you want to know more, use <em>View Source</em> or visit
	this little thing <a

		<h3>dots.</h3>
		<time datetime="2014-03-16">March 2014</time>
		<p>A dot-grouping line-drawing thing based on Vi Hart's video
		<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-pyuaThp-c">"Connecting Dots"</a>.</p>

		<p>The code is kind of very weird, but maybe there's a more
		general pattern between those tiny things?</p>

		<p>Go, <a href="./dots.html">draw some dots!</a>. (Watch the video
		first video to get an idea for what might be interesting.)</p>

		<h3>trixl.</h3>
		<time datetime="2014-01-05">January 2014</time>
		<p>A three-dimensial version of pixl, currently without the
		collaborative features, but some version of that is planned.
		(Either by working in the same world or by sharing the code for
		worlds.)</p>

		<p>I could have use <a href="http://voxeljs.com">voxel.js</a> or
		<a href="http://threejs.org">three.js</a> for this, but didn't as
		I wanted to understand WebGL/OpenGL better. I sort-of succeeded,
		but this is still very much a prototype.</p>

		<p>It's live at <a href="http://pixl.papill0n.org/3">pixl.papill0n.org/3</a>
		and the source is <a href="https://github.com/heyLu/lp/tree/master/js/pixl#trixl">on GitHub</a>.
		But to really have some fun with it you'll want to use it's api
		which is availlable as the <code>trixl</code> object on the
		page.</p>

		<p>Start by running <code>trixl.generate.fun()</code> and looking
		at the source for it.</p>

		<h3>pixl.</h3>
		<time datetime="2013-12-17">December 2013</time>
		<p>A collaborative, in-browser, programmable canvas composed of
		pixls.</p>

		<p>See it live at <a href="http://pixl.papill0n.org">pixl.papill0n.org</a>.
		The source is <a href="https://github.com/heyLu/lp/tree/master/js/pixl#pixl">on GitHub</a>.

		<p>As with trixl, this has been created for <a href="http://codegirls.de">codegirls</a>
		to be able to try out javascript in an interactive
		environment.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>formula.</h3>
		<time datetime="2012-12-16">December 2012</time>
		<p>An interactive formula editor, with a simple syntax that is as
		close to what you would write on paper as is feasible to implement
		within a few regexes and in less than 6 hours total.</p>

		<p>I rather like that you can explore math things quickly. For
		example you can start out with <code type="x-papill0n.org/formula">sin(x)</code>
		and then decide that it doesn't look all that interesting and
		change it to <code type="x-papill0n.org/formula">sin(x) + 0.1x</code>
		and be happy that it looks a bit funny.</p>

		<p>A few other formula's that you might want to try (click to view
		them):
		
			<ul>
				<li><code type="x-papill0n.org/formula">sin(x/3)*x^2*0.001</code></li>
				<li><code type="x-papill0n.org/formula">0.01x*x*0.001tan(x)</code></li>
			</ul>
		<p>

		<p><a href="./formula.html">Go, try it!</a> (And tell me what you
		think.)</p>

		<h3>generative.</h3>
		<time datetime="2012-10-29">October 2012</time>
		<p>Procedurally generated worlds fascinate me. I've been dabbling
		with them for quite some time and this is the farthest I've gone with
		them so far.</p>

		<p>This demo is inspired by <a href="http://introversion.co.uk">Introversion's</a>
		<a href="http://www.introversion.co.uk/subversion">Subversion</a>.
		It uses the techniques layed out in Parish' and MÃ¼ller's
		<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/aliaga/cs197-10/papers/p_cities.pdf">
		Procedural Modelling of Cities</a>, but doesn't implement all of
		it. Most notably it is missing different pattern algorithms.</p>

		<h3>shady business</h3>
		<time datetime="2012-10-12">October 2012</time>
		<p><a href="http://thomaswasalone.com">Thomas Was Alone</a>.</p>

		<p>The shading in the above mentioned game was one of the things that
		I love about it. There are a lot of things to love about it, but I
		wanted to experiment with the shadows. (I'm not done yet.)</p>

		<p>So I built a little demo with cubie things (and a ball) falling
		down and casting shades around. You may wish to control the shadow
		with your mouse or other pointing device.</p>

		<h3>osmotive.</h3>
		<time datetime="2012-05-12">May 2012</time>
		<p>As with the <em>shady business</em>, this little thing was
		inspired by a game. That game is <a href="http://www.hemispheregames.com/osmos/">
		Osmos</a>. It is quite beautiful and the growing mechanic
		fascinated me. So I built one for the Web.</p>
