	<h2>A few little things I made for you (and myself, too).</h2>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>formula.</h3>
		<time datetime="2012-12-16">December 2012</time>
		<p>An interactive formula editor, with a simple syntax that is as
		close to what you would write on paper as is feasible to implement
		within a few regexes and in less than 6 hours total.</p>

		<p>I rather like that you can explore math things quickly. For
		example you can start out with <code>sin(x)</code> and then decide
		that it doesn't look all that interesting and change it to
		<code type="x-papill0n/formula">sin(x) + 0.1x</code> and be happy
		that it looks a bit funny.</p>

		<p>A few other formula's that you might want to try:
		
			<ul>
				<li><code>sin(x/3)*x^2*0.001</code></li>
				<li><code>0.01x*x*0.001tan(x)</code></li>
				<li><code>...</code></li>
				<li><code>...</code></li>
			</ul>

		<h3>generative.</h3>
		<time datetime="2012-10-29">October 2012</time>
		<p>Procedurally generated worlds fascinate me. I've been dabbling
		with them for quite some time and this is the farthest I've gone with
		them so far.</p>

		<p>This demo is inspired by <a href="http://introversion.co.uk">Introversion's</a>
		<a href="...">Subversion</a>. It uses the techniques layed out in
		[paper], but doesn't implement all of it. Most notably it is missing
		different pattern algorithms and smarter [things].</p>

		<h3>shady business</h3>
		<time datetime="2012-10-12">October 2012</time>
		<p><a href="http://thomaswasalone.com">Thomas Was Alone</a>.</p>

		<p>The shading in the above mentioned game was one of the things that
		I love about it. There are a lot of things to love about it, but I
		wanted to experiment with it. (I'm not done yet.)</p>

		<p>So I built a little demo with cubie things (and a ball) falling
		down and casting shades around. You may wish to control the shadow
		with your mouse or other pointing device.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>osmotive.</h3>
		<time datetime="2012-05-12">May 2012</time>
		<p>As with the <em>shady business</em>, this little thing was
		inspired by a game. That game is <a href="...">Osmos</a>. It is quite
		beautiful and the growing mechanic fascinated me. So I built one for
		the Web.</p>

		<h3>zero.</h3>

		<p>The most soothing thing ever.</p>

		<p>Sleep well.</p>
