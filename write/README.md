# write - A simple writing environment

Inspired by iA Writer and the recent release of
[ProseMirror](http://prosemirror.net).

## Quickstart

```
# Prepare prosemirror (not currently open-source, thus not on NPM yet)
$ git clone git://github.com/Prosemirror/prosemirror
$ cd prosemirror
$ npm run dist
$ cd ..
$ cp -R prosemirror/dist prosemirror-dist

# Install dependencies and build js
$ npm install
$ npm run dist
```
