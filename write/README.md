# write - A simple writing environment

Inspired by iA Writer and the recent release of
[ProseMirror](http://prosemirror.net).

Try it out at <https://heylu.github.io/weird_dreams/write/>.

## Quickstart

```
# Prepare prosemirror (not currently open-source, thus not on NPM yet)
$ git clone git://github.com/Prosemirror/prosemirror
$ cd prosemirror
$ npm run dist
$ cd ..

# Install dependencies and build js
$ npm install
$ npm run dist

# Open `index.html` in your browser
```
