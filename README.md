# Welcome, stranger!

This is a little place where strange ideas live.

## Who?

Currently, only *osmotive*, a shameless [Osmos](http://www.hemispheregames.com/osmos/)
ripoff and a little grid-demo live here. <del>They still feel very
lonely.</del> Actually, since that shady business thing they don't feel
quite as alone.

You can see them all in [a live-action party](http://heyLu.github.io/weird_dreams).

### Things about things

 * [shady\_business](shady_business.html): An experiment at "shading" a
 	quadrilateral world. Inspired by the shading in [Thomas Was
 	Alone](http://thomaswasalone.com).

 	If you like math, *beware*! You might not want to look at it. But if
 	you're here to help (white knight, you), I'd be happy to hear about
 	stuff in an [issue](weird_dreams/issues).
